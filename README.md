 What I accomplished : Built an image classification model using CNN that achieved over 95% accuracy in identifying common potato leaf diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight.

 What I did : Collected and cleaned a dataset of labeled potato leaf images from open-source repositories (PlantVillage). Applied image preprocessing techniques like resizing, 
 normalization, and data augmentation. Designed and trained a CNN model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and 
 F1- score. Developed a simple GUI using Streamlet that allows users (farmers/agronomists) to upload leaf images for instant disease prediction.

 Impact/Result : Provided a cost-effective and accessible solution for early disease detection, helping reduce crop losses and improve yield for potato farmers.
 
 Real-World Problem: Potato crops are highly vulnerable to leaf diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight, which often go undetected in early stages and cause major losses in yield. 
 Traditional disease detection methods require expert intervention and may not be accessible or timely for rural farmers.

 Solution Provided: The project offers an AI-driven solution that enables farmers and agricultural stakeholders to detect diseases early using just images of potato leaves. With a high- 
 accuracy CNN model integrated into a user-friendly GUI, the solution empowers timely intervention and informed decision-making, minimizing damage and boosting crop productivity.
